## Buggs

Fixes:

Instead of having play / pause button i made toggle for music playback.

Added if check if audio is found or not because it was giving error message in the consle when i i pressed a key that didnt exist else!

Using data-key function for the pad sample player so i can reuse the function and i only have to give the onclick the same number as the data-key that i use for the "keyPlay" function. Reusing as much as possible!
